# China's Investment Projects and their Impact on Regime Characteristics
Using financial and investment data from Aiddata (College of William and Mary) and regime characteristics data from the Polity IV series (Center for Systemic Peace) from 2000 - 2014, I investigated whether China has indeed had an impact on countries becoming more democratic or autocratic. The project involves data cleaning, wrangling, visualization, time-series analysis, and data analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The data coming from Aiddata and the Polity IV series packed a lot of information. After cleaning and wrangling the data to get it where I wanted to be, I explored much of what the data had to offer.
